\subsection{Terminal Object}

For a category $C$, an object $1$ is said to be terminal when there exists a
unique morphism $f: c\to 1$ for every object $c\in C$.

e.g. In Set, the singleton set is a terminal object. From every other set
there exists a unique function into the singleton set, that being the constant
function.

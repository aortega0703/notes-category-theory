\subsection{Initial Object}

For a category $C$, an object $0$ is said to be initial when there exists a
unique morphism $f: 0\to c$ for every object $c\in C$.
\parencite{awodey:category_theory}

e.g. In Set, the empty set is an initial object. There exists only one function
from it to every other set, that being the empty function.

\subsubsection*{Uniqueness up to isomorphism}

Consider a category with a pair of terminal objects $c$ and $c'$. By being
terminal there exists a unique morphism from any object into $c$ and $c'$,
particularly, there exists unique morphisms $f: c' \to c$, $g: c \to c'$ between
themselves and $\id_c: c\to c$, $\id_c: c\to c$ to themselves.
Then the compositions $f\circ g:c\to c$ and $g\circ f:c' \to c'$ must coincide
with the identity morphisms, making $f,g$ an isomorphism between $c$ and $c'$.

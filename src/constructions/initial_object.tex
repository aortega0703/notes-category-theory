\subsection{Terminal Object}

For a category $C$, an object $0$ is said to be initial when there exists a
unique morphism $f: 0\to c$ for every object $c\in C$.
\cite{awodey:category_theory}

e.g. In Set, the empty set is an initial object. There exists only one function
from it to every other set, that being the empty function.

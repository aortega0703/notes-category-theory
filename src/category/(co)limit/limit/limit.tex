\begin{definition}[Limit]\index{Limit}

	The limit of a functor $F$ is a terminal object in
	$\mathrm{cone}(F)$~\parencite[p.~118]{leinster:basic_category_theory}.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Uniqueness of Limits]\label{thm:limit_iso}
	The limit of a functor is unique up to isomorphism.

	\begin{proof}
		A limit can be seen as a terminal morphism, which are unique up to
		Isomorphism (Theorem \ref{thm:terminal_morphism_iso}), therefore limits are
		also unique up to isomorphism.
	\end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Complete Category]\index{Complete Category}
	A category $\C$ is (small) complete if it has limits for all functors $F:\I
	\to \C$ from small categories $\I$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Cartesian Closed Category]\index{Cartesian Closed Category} A
	category $\C$ is cartesian closed if it is finitely complete and has
	exponentiation.
\end{definition}
